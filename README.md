# Directive-Based-Statistical-Analysis-Project

📌 Project Overview

This project involves the statistical examination of two structured datasets—one continuous and one binary—following a directive-based framework. The goal was to apply statistical techniques, summarize data behavior, measure variability, and interpret patterns across 100+ variables. The project demonstrates competency in descriptive analytics, probability, and data-driven interpretation using Excel.

 Directive 1 — Numerical Data Analysis

The Directive 1 dataset consists of 100 columns of continuous variables representing numeric measurements.

 Analytical Techniques

Descriptive Statistics:
Computed central tendency and variability metrics including:

- Mean

- Median

- Standard Deviation

- Variance

- Minimum & Maximum

- Range

Data Profiling:

- Identified high-variance vs. low-variance variables

- Compared distribution shapes and spread

- Detected potential outliers

- Evaluated consistency across numerical features

Excel Functions Utilized:
AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV.P, VAR.P, MIN, MAX, PERCENTILE, conditional formatting, and summary tables.

 Outcomes

- Clear statistical summary for each variable

- Distribution-level insights

- Identified patterns useful for further modeling or decision-making

 Directive 2 — Binary Data Analysis

The Directive 2 dataset contains 100 columns of binary (0/1) categorical indicators.

 Analytical Techniques

Frequency Analysis:

- Total count of 1s and 0s per variable

- Relative proportions to compute P(X=1) and P(X=0)

Probability Assessment:

- Interpreted binary outcomes as probabilistic events

- Compared likelihoods across variables

- Identified highly skewed vs. balanced distributions

Excel Functions Utilized:
COUNTIF, COUNT, proportion formulas, pivot-style summaries

 Outcomes

- Full probability breakdown across binary features

- Identification of strong vs. weak indicators

- Categorical pattern recognition across all variables
